            <p class="p1">Ever since I can remember, design has been a cornerstone of my life. As a child, I found immense joy in creating—whether it was decorating my school books or crafting personalized designs for my assignments. These early experiences sparked a passion that has guided me through every stage of my career. Starting with active participation in online design communities, such as <strong>Kooora.com</strong>, I explored new ways to express creativity and connect with like-minded individuals, laying the foundation for my career in design and digital communication.</p>

            <h2 className="small-title">Elevating My Craft Through Education.</h2>
            <p class="p1">My formal journey in design took off in the United States, where I pursued a degree in Graphic Design. During my time at the University of New Haven, I cultivated my creative vision and gained recognition for my unique approach to visual storytelling and communication. From winning design competitions to being featured on the Dean’s List, my university years were marked by constant growth. I embraced every opportunity—whether it was creating award-winning event posters or designing the university’s official tie.</p>
            <p>A significant part of my education involved blending modern design principles with <strong>Islamic art,</strong> bringing cultural elements into my work in new and meaningful ways. This fusion of tradition and modernity became a signature of my style and an important aspect of my creative and communication identity.</p>

            <p>Concerning classes, I consistently contributed to the department's success by taking the lead on multiple occasions, guiding fellow students to elevate the quality of our projects. I cultivated positive relationships with both staff and students, and many of them remain in contact with me to this day.</p>
            <p>On the technical front, my focus centered on showcasing the beauty of Islamic art and demonstrating its seamless integration into the modern realm of design. Throughout numerous projects, I incorporated elements of Islamic art into the final products, imparting a distinctive touch to my designs.</p>
